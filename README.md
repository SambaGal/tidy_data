# Creating Tidy Data

Included is a script called **run_analysis.R** that contains commands to load and clean the data.

The data set is included in the **code_book.md** file. I recommend to read it using the read.table function and to set the headear to be equal to TRUE. The dimensions of this data set are 180 x 68.

**features_updated.txt** the modified code book that contains the variable descriptions. Recomend to Open it in RStudio editor where it is very readable.
